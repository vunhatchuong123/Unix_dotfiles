# Unix_dotfiles

## Overview

---

My Unix dotfiles managed by [Chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

Despite the title, this is my first dotfile for [Endeavouros](endeavouros.com/) distro. Not tested on other distros yet but it should be fine.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://dub.sh/JBAKP3G)"
```
